## Comments

1. Solution contains several projects to decompose code according to improve maintenability
2. The fileparser.host contains console application. An example of run is fileparser.host.exe "../../../../testdirectory"  "result.txt"
The Source Control contains little files to process
3. Net Core 3.0 is used just to try the new promising idea of using SPAN\Memory\Pipelines. I need more time to decrease the memory footprint using 
this technology. I believe many improvements might be done.
